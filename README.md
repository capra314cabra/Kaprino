**kaprino** is a new programming language which lies **great emphasis on the correctness of the result** of programs.  
It is recommended for people who want to do some **mathematical** stuffs **strictly**.

Also, its syntax is as close to mathematics as possible. It's because I would like to see it used by not only people who are familiar with programming but also those who are new to programming!

This project lacks some features yet. I would be appreciate it if you contribute to this project no matter how it is small.

## üì¢ IMPORTANT NOTICE

We moved a language for developing kaprino from C++ to Rust in the view of maintainability.   
However, kaprino written by Rust haven't been stable yet, so if you want to access stable kaprino, written by C++, please refer to [cpp-HEAD](https://github.com/kaprino-lang/kaprino/tree/cpp-HEAD) branch in this repository.
